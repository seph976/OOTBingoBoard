# OOT Bingo Board
This is a very simple bingo board for Ocarina of Time, especially made for randomizers.

Even though its made to be used with randomized roms, you can still use this for normal OOT roms aswell, but it wont have the same logic that a lot of other bingo boards out there have, so it might not be balanced if not using a randomizer.

I recommend using this: https://github.com/AmazingAmpharos/OoT-Randomizer

This bingo board has a lot of options which will be explained individually further down on the page, i wanted to make the bingo board customizable for people who might only want certain things on their bingo board for more unique runs.

In addition, it is made to be small and simple with visual icons instead of text to better fit streams.
